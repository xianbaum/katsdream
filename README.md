<h1>Kat's dream is a path-drawing game by Christian Baum.</h1>

The player draws a path from the player to wherever you want to go. In general, the player character must avoid obstacles, enemy lasers and shoot the enemeis blocking their path. This is not an easy game.

Requires Eclipse with the Gradle add-on and the Android SDK to build.
